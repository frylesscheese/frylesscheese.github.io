		<h1>Fries should not be consumed. Cheese is supreme.</h1>
		
		<p1>Fries are an abomination of mankind. Everyone knows the truth -- cheese is the best. Better than fries.
			Below are examples of things that are not okay:</p1>

			This abomination has cheese wasted on fries. 
			Who in their right mind would think this is ok? 
			To waste cheese like this should be a crime!

				This example is not as bad. There is no sign of cheese in the fries, but it is a waste of a meal to eat fries instead of cheese!
				Shame on the losers who would choose this over cheese.

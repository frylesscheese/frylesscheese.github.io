		<h1>Fries should not be consumed. Cheese is supreme.</h1>
		
		<p>Fries are an abomination of mankind. 
			</br>Everyone knows the truth -- cheese is the best. Better than fries.
			Below are examples of things that are not okay:

			This abomination has cheese wasted on fries. 
			Who in their right mind would think this is ok? 
			To waste cheese like this should be a crime!

				This example is not as bad. There is no sign of cheese in the fries, but it is a waste of a meal to eat fries instead of cheese!
				Shame on the losers who would choose this over cheese.

			Anybody caught eating Cheesefries or Fries will be punished by being told that they are losers.
			Anybody who eats these foods instead of cheese is lame, and this is a fact.

		<h1>Fries should not be consumed. Cheese is supreme.</h1>
		
		<p>Fries are an abomination of mankind. 
			</br>Everyone knows the truth -- cheese is the best. Better than fries.
			Below are examples of things that are not okay:
		</p>
		<br/><br/>
			<!-- Begin  CheeseFries -->
		<p1>
			<a href="https://twitter.com/cheesefriesguy">
				<img src="images/cheesefries.jpg" alt="A gross perversion of cheese with fries" 
				   title="Nasty fries with cheese wasted on top of them." width="600" height="450" />
			</a><br/>
			This abomination has cheese wasted on fries. 
			Who in their right mind would think this is ok? 
			To waste cheese like this should be a crime!

			<!-- Begin Cheeseless Fries -->

				   title="Nasty fries with mo cheese." width="600" height="450" />	
			</a><br/>
			This example is not as bad. There is no sign of cheese in the fries, but it is a waste of a meal to eat fries instead of cheese!
			Shame on the losers who would choose this over cheese.

			Anybody caught eating Cheesefries or Fries will be punished by being told that they are losers.
			Anybody who eats these foods instead of cheese is lame, and this is a fact.
